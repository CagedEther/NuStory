# **How empathy mapping can help focus customer interviews**

At the outset of any marketing campaign, it is important to understand user needs in as much detail as possible. The empathy mapping framework provides a great way to plan and conduct user interviews so that you gather as much information as possible. While the concept of empathy mapping was originally tied to design thinking, it has been adapted by various industries including software design, healthcare, education, and beyond. 

## **What is an empathy map?**

An empathy map is typically a large, empty quadrant diagram, which the team fills out collaboratively. The categories for the four quadrants are typically as follows:

- **Think and Feel:** What is going through the user’s mind? What matters to them?
- **Hear:** What are some things the user might hear in their environment? What are people telling them?
- **See:** What is the user exposed to visually in their environment? What are they watching or reading?
- **Say and Do:** What might the user say or do in public? How do they behave?

To these can be added additional sections which are particularly useful for marketing campaigns:

- **Pains:** What challenges, obstacles, or difficulties is the user experiencing or trying to avoid?
- **Gains:** What does the user want to achieve? What are their goals and motivations?

## **Using empathy maps for interviews**

Empathy maps can be an excellent tool to prepare for, conduct, and analyze interviews. They help create a structured framework for understanding what you need to learn about your interviewee.

Before the interview they can be useful to develop the questions that will give you the most useful insights. How does the user feel about the product/service category in which you operate? What do they think about and what is their decision-making process? What is the social and physical environment they are in? Building out a sheet with all the questions listed in the empathy map categories can help organize a user interview and keep it focused. 

During the interview, use the sheet to guide the discussion, and write notes within the specific sections. If the interview starts to drift off-topic, a glance at the empathy map can help steer the conversation back to areas that offer valuable insights.

After the interview, you can write up the notes using the format of the empathy map quadrant to help organize ideas. [Tools like Mural](https://www.mural.co/) allow you to store and collaborate on this information digitally. Look specifically for insights on which you can act.  

## Using Generative AI to analyze interviews

Once you have a recording of an interview transcribed, you can use tools like ChatGPT or Claude to analyze the text from the interview which can be faster than going through it manually. You can even interrogate the text with prompts like “tell me from this document what are the biggest pain points that the user is feeling.” This can be particularly helpful for getting to key information fast.

## Using empathy maps across your marketing strategy

An empathy map you have created around your user is a useful tool in building out a marketing strategy. It can help you define customer segments, identify motivators for use in content creation, think about how you position a product or service, develop your brand voice and image, and think of ways to improve the customer experience. Think about how you can use empathy mapping to develop more customer-centric marketing campaigns.
